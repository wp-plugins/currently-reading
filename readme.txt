Displays a cover image of a book with a link to Google Books based on a supplied ISBN-10 or ISBN-13.

== Description ==
Supplying an [ISBN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number) (and, optionally, a Title) will display a cover image of the relevant book with a link to that book's page on [Google Books](http://books.google.co.za/) using the Google Books API.

Using the Widget you can choose whether to:

* Pad the Image (selected by default, uses internal CSS)
* Display a Box-Shadow (selected by default, uses internal CSS)
* Choose Alternate Google Country (defaults to "South Africa" since books.google.com seems to give a "500" error and South Africa seems to work just fine for US clients as well)

as well as

* Decide whether you would like to use a Title
* Define the ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 of the book.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I Get a '*Warning: file_get_contents ... : failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden*' Error on My Blog With No Books Displayed. Why Is This Happening?**

Your web-site has been configure not to allow outgoing HTTP requests and you have 'Use Google API' enabled or Google rejected your connection.

If the automated fail-back failed, please de-select the 'Use Google API' option to use the direct connection instead nd report this as a bug.

**I Get a '*No Google Books Entry Found for ISBN:NUMBER*' on My Blog... Why?**

Sometimes Google Books does not return any valid responses on ISBNs. Try the following:

1. See if you can find an alternate ISBN for the book
2. Toggle the "Use Google API" option
3. Find the eBook on Google's Books Web Page and use its ISBN

**I Get an *Image Not Available* Image on My Blog Instead of the Book Cover, and Clicking It Gives Me a Google 404 Error**

You will only see this if you are *not* using the Google Books API or, if you are, it failed back to the previous system for some reason.

Double-check the ISBN you used; it's either wrong or Google does not have an entry for the book referenced.

**Are You Planning to Insert Other Sources Than Google Books to the Currently Reading Widget?**

I'll have a look into supporting Amazon, though they do make you jump through hoops to use their API (which is the reason I settled on using Google Books to start with).

**Is There a Way to Get This Plug-In to Do a Library of All of Your Books Into WordPress?**

It's not currently possible with this plug-in, no.

I'll give it a bit of thought and see if I can extend it to do that; but it will most likely need the creation of an alternate plugin to do that.

This would likely require its own database table to do properly, as well...
